        <l1> 
            I am an American-Canadian student from Atlanta. I moved to Canada when I was 6. <br>
            I went to Unionville High School, and graduated from the STEM program with honours.<br>
            Some of my hobbies are programming, biking, and gaming.<br>
            I'm excited for RIT!<br>

            <br>I love all sorts of dumplings!! Including wontons, potstickers, even pierogis, if those count. Any filling is great!
